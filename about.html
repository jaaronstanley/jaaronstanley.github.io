  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>
  I'm an 13-year tech industry veteran that is passionate about the co-creation of impactful digital products and experiences.  My most recent experience is at Capital One where I lead a team of designers in our Tech space.  In my spare time, I like helping people tell their stories by producing digital video shorts.  Most recently, I learned Front End Web Development through my friends at General Assembly (I also built this website from scratch).  I've primarily worked in Fortune 500 companies (IBM, Capital One), but also started my own video production company in 2014.

  I would be remiss if I didn't thank the following people, organizations, and enablers for getting me here:  my beautiful wife, General Assembly, Burning Man, Adaptive Path, and coffee (you da real mvp!).
